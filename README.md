# The-Witcher.network

I took on this project for two reasons: 

a) I recently watch the Netflix version of the books. And I think it came out pretty good. It is not a perfect show of course, but I did enjoyed it. 

b) Since The Witcher is originally from Poland and because not I live here, it seem natural for me to take on this new thrill and task to analyze the 8 books. 


Analizing the character's relationship along the whole 8 books.
